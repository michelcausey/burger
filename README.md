# Before You Begin

* Rob's Burgers is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger in the "not eaten" section -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the "eaten" side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
